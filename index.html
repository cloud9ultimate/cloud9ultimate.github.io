					<h3><a href "#">A Word From the Captains</a></h3>
					<p>Ultimate is a sport played with a disc (frisbee). Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc (maintain a pivot), and interceptions and incomplete passes are turnovers. At peak play there is a higher cooperation within the striving competition. Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match, with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play. A prominent feature of the modern game is the "lay out," a horizontal dive to catch or block the disc.</p>
